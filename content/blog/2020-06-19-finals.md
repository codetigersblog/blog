Today was the final round for DECOV2020 and many candidates have submitted their projects with a hope. Its's been a roller coaster ride for us and even for all the participating teams. The participants were really talented and came up with good solutions in their respective domains and of course with their own problem statements and solutions. So, while wrapping everything I hope may the best team wins.
